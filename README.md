Character building tool in the web.
This is a tool for the old school pen and paper role players that never remember to bring their character sheets or rule books. It is also a tool to simplify all the rules for calculations of BEG on skills and such.
This is a Swedish game, and therefor the gui is written in swedish.

Scaffolded from The lovely [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) generator [Angular fullstack](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack)
